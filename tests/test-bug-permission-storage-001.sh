# test-bug-permission-storage-001.sh - BUG #6: Adding already registered files overwrites stored permissions
#
# This file tests the following bug from docs/BUGS.md:
#
# Bug #6: Adding already registered files overwrites their stored permissions
#
# From BUGS.md:
# "If we have a folder that contains some files that are guarded and now we add
# those files again to a collection, we're overwriting the original read-write
# ownership permissions with the ones of the guarded state. So this must never
# happen. There must not be any way to update the permissions of a file in the
# .guard file after the file has been added."
#
# "I suggest that what we do is compare the current owner, group, and permissions
# of a file to be added with the default guarded state configured in the guard
# file. If they are the same, we should display a warning and say that we are
# not adding this file since it already contains the same permissions as the
# guarded state."
#
# Tests are designed to FAIL when the bug exists, PASS when fixed.
