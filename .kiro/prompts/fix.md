# Fix Next CI Issue

Run `just ci-quiet`, identify the next failing test or error, and implement the minimal fix needed to resolve it. Keep iterating until CI passes.

Focus on:
1. Missing commands (implement minimal version)
2. Failing tests (fix the specific issue)
3. Build/lint errors (resolve quickly)

Use the existing patterns and keep implementations minimal.
